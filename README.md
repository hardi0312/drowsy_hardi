Project Title: Driver Drowsiness Detection System.

About project: Drowsiness detection system are designed to monitor a person's level of alertness and detect signs of drowsiness or fatigue.
               Drowsiness detection system can use a variety of methods to detect signs of drowsiness, including physiological signals such
               as eye movement,as well as behavioral data such as steering wheel movements,eye tracking ,facial recognition and machine 
               learning algorithm.
               
Working: Drowsy Driver Detection System has been developed, using the intrusive machine vision-based
         concepts. The system uses a web camera that points directly towards the driver’s face and monitors 
         the driver’s eye movements in order to detect fatigue. In such a case when fatigue is detected, a 
         warning signal is issued to alert the driver. The system deals with detecting eyes within the specific 
         segment of the face. If these are not found for 20consecutive frames, the system draws the
         conclusion that the driver is falling asleep. In this project we have developed drowsiness detection 
         system by using Python. The input video is captured by using webcam (camera) and then it will be 
         extracted. The face and eye detection are done by using OpenCV.By using the Euclidean eye aspect 
         ratio, we can get eye blinking ratio, it helps to detect eithereyes are open or closed. It will detect the 
         face and eyes of the driver by using the given commands. Then it will detect whether the eyes of 
         driver are open or close. If the eyes are closed more than given time interval it will warn the driver 
         by playing the alarm.
